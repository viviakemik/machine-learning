Functions derived from Chapter 10: Bet Sizing
Only the highest-level user functions are included in the __init__ file.

This folder contains classes and functions for sizing bets based on a given investment strategy with given bet side
confidence, e.g. the output from a machine learning model. The approaches implemented in this module are based on
those described in Chapter 10 of "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" by Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado.
